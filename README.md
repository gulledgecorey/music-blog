## Credits

Bulma documentation https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/ . We used bulma to style our handlebars.

The use of a Spotify api https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-url-info . With this api we are able to get the song data for people to post on the webpage.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5WWrGMsnpw Helped style the login and signup css.

Our TA Jessica she guided us in the right direction every class and she helped out so much with errors in our routes on insomnia and helped out a lot with the handlebars. She also took time to do one on one work to help out.

The University of Minnesota bootcamp, we took a lot of inspiration from 14-MVC's mini project especially with the handlebars, routes and the standard file structures.
